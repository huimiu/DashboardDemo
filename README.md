# Add a new Graph API call

1. Add consent scope first.

   You can call `addNewScope(scopes: string[])` to consent the scopes of permissions you want to add. And the consented status will be preserved in a global context `FxContext`.
2. Create a graph client by adding the scope related to the Graph API you want to call. 

   You can refer to the following code snippet:
   ```ts
   let teamsfx: TeamsFx;
   teamsfx = FxContext.getInstance().getTeamsFx();
   ```
3. Call the Graph API, and parse the response into a certain model, which will be used by front-end.

   You can refer to the following code snippet:
   ```ts
   try {
     const graphClient: Client = createMicrosoftGraphClient(teamsfx, scope);
     const graphApiResult = await graphClient.api("<GRAPH_API_PATH>").get();
     // Parse the graphApiResult into a Model you defined, used by the front-end.
   } catch(e) {} 
   ```
